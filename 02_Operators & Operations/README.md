## Data Types

There are mainly 5 data type in Python which are used most frequently:

- Integer
- String
- Float
- Boolean (it can either be True or False)
- None (there's no null in Python, only None)

Apart from this there are some other built-in data types which Python provides such as list, dictionary, etc.

```python
print(12, type(12))                 # int
print('Python', type('Python'))     # str
print(34.7, type(34.7))             # float
print(True, type(True))             # bool
print(None, type(None))             # NoneType
```
